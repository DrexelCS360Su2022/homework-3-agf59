Problem 1: 40m
The hardest part about this problem was figuring out how to implement 'error, where for some reason the error? function wasn't being picked up if I didn't have it at the exact place it was.

Problem 2: 335m
This problem gave me a lot of trouble. Frankly, I just didn't understand the inner workings of the mcevaluator well enough going into it. I persevered, though, and managed to figure it out almost entirely on my own with some help from a TA.
